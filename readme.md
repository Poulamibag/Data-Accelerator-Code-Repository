# Data Accelerator Code Repository

Our objective is to develop a middleware solution capable of seamlessly transforming diverse customer data formats into standardized formats compatible with Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), specifically XDM JSON, XDM Parquet, or delimited files. This solution aims to streamline the process of data ingestion and preprocessing, providing essential ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) functionalities, advanced data profiling, and customizable transformation capabilities to address specific business requirements.
